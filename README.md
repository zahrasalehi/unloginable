unloginable

dumb ways to create authentication for websites :D

still ways to add but it is just have logical and ui/ux problems

for example it doen't use any jwt or some what token and it is not loginable(! made-up name)
it donest user friendly and specially some dumb pple cant login wich i think is a good idea :D

forget about the misspled. if it bothers you, just ignore it :))
